If downloaded. Extract to Desktop.

Ensure you have C++ complier (g++) downloaded. You can follow the steps [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-mingw) 

Once done. Open up my project folder through a terminal. Compile the CPP file, you can name the output with whatever you want. 

In this example I will name it "Deafelopment", for this I will put in "g++ Deafelopment.cpp -o Deafelopment" in the terminal without the speechmarks.

Now we will have a Deafelopment.exe in the folder.

To run this, simply put in the terminal "./Deafelopment"

There you have it! I used Git Bash for my terminal, but any should do the trick.
